Nocturnal enuresis in children. A four-year experience in outpatient clinics of pediatric urology.
AIM:
We present our experience in the treatment of enuresis at the Pediatric Urology Outpatient Office over a period of four years. We report pertinent epidemiological data, diagnostic workup, as well as routine treatment protocol.
MATERIAL AND METHODS:
Between April 1998 and May 2002, 142 healthy children, aged between 6.5 and 18 years (mean: 9 +/- 0.5 years), were referred to us for bedwetting. Ninety three of them were boys and 49--girls. Eight of them had also concurrent daytime enuresis. According to our protocol, the type of enuresis was identified (primary or secondary) and then we administered the respective treatment. Sixteen children underwent behavioural therapy only. Fifteen children with detrusor instability received oxybutinine or tolterodine. Twenty children with diurnal and nocturnal enuresis were given desmopressin and oxybutinine or desmopressin and tolterodine. The remaining 91 children received monotherapy with desmopressin (individualized dose). The initial follow up ranged from 3 to 6 months.
RESULTS:
Out of 111 children receiving desmopressin, 66 stopped wetting, but 28 relapsed in two weeks and treatment continued for 3 more months. Nine children became dry. In the other groups there was almost complete response to treatment.
CONCLUSION:
Enuresis continues to be a suppressed problem for both children and parents; however, effective treatment is possible.
